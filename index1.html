                    In my current project, I am passionately engaged in developing an innovative solution aimed at bridging communication gaps for the hearing and speaking impaired. The project focuses on the generation of sign language from audio inputs, creating a valuable tool for individuals who rely on sign language for communication. Leveraging my skills in audio processing and machine learning, I am working on the development of a robust system that accurately translates spoken words into corresponding sign language gestures. Additionally, I am integrating this technology seamlessly into video conferencing applications, thereby fostering inclusivity in virtual communication environments.
